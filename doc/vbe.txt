SOS VBE Graphics
Authors: James Letendre

[Purpose]
The purpose of VBE Graphics it to provide a method of graphical output other
than the default text mode. 

[Design]
VBE Graphics consists of two main parts. 

First, there is real-mode bootstrap code which talks with the BIOS to find and
set the desired video mode. This code stores the VBE controller info and the VBE
mode info which was set.

Second, there is kernel level code which handles writes to the framebuffer in
the kernel. This code uses the VBE info structures saved by the bootstrap code.

A font was developed to allow for c_io to be ported over and useable with the
graphics enabled.

[Interface]
This code is only accessed internally by the kernel, more specifically the
kernel windowing code. Writes by the kernel to the framebuffer are passed
through the _vbe_draw_pixel(...) function.
