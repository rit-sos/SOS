NAME
	map

DESCRIPTION
	Map of the user programs in the build image. A simple two-column text
	file where the first column is the name of the program image and the
	second column is the offset into the build image. The offset becomes
	the physical address and kernel virtual address of the image in memory.

	The map file is also used to generate the program ID and offset list
	used for exec().
