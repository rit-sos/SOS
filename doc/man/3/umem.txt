SYNOPSIS
	User-mode heap manager overview

DESCRIPTION
	The user-mode heap manager is functionally almost identical to the
	kernel-mode equivalent described in the heaps module documentation.

	The user-mode heap manager provides the functionality of malloc, realloc,
	and free to user programs.

	The heap manager maintains a linked list of heap allocations and
	inserts, removes, and appends new allocations in that list as needed.
	The heap manager is also responsible for growing the heap via the
	grow_heap system call, and establishing the heap at program startup
	via the get_heap_base and get_heap_size system calls.

	The major difference between the user and kernel heaps is that user heaps
	start out as copy-on-write mappings to a page that is all zeroes.

	The heap manager initialization routine is called by the ustrap before
	main starts.
