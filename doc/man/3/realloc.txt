NAME
	realloc

SYNOPSIS
	void *realloc(void *ptr, int new_size)

DESCRIPTION
	Resizes an existing heap allocation to at least new_size bytes. The buffer
	pointed to by ptr may be copied and a new pointer returned if resizing the
	buffer in-place is not possible. Only pointers returned from malloc or
	realloc should be passed into realloc. Any pointers into the allocated
	region should be considered invalid after calling realloc on it.

RETURN VALUE
	Pointer to the new allocation, or NULL if the allocation fails.
