NAME
	shm_create

SYNOPSIS
	Status shm_create(const char *name, int min_size,
	                  unsigned int flags, void **ptr)

DESCRIPTION
	Creates a new named shared memory region, maps it, and returns a pointer
	to the beginning of it. The region will not be created if a region already
	exists by the same name.

	The only valid values for flags are SHM_WRITE, which creates a writable
	region, and 0, which creates a read-only region.

	shm_create is actually a wrapper around another function called
	real_shm_create, which performs the actual system call and adds an extra
	parameter, which is the length of the name string.

RETURN VALUE
	SUCCESS if the region is created with no errors
	BAD_PARAM if the flags parameter is invalid
	ALREADY_EXISTS if the name is already in use
	ALLOC_FAILED if there is no free memory to back the shared memory
		region, if there is no room in the caller's address space, or
		if an internal data structure allocation fails
