NAME
	shm_close

SYNOPSIS
	Status shm_close(const char *name)

DESCRIPTION
	Releases a reference to a named shared memory region. If this was the last
	reference to the region then the region descriptor is discarded and the
	physical memory backing it is freed. Any pointers into the closed mapping
	are invalid after calling shm_close.

	shm_close is actually a wrapper around another function called
	real_shm_close, which performs the actual system call and adds an extra
	parameter, which is the length of the name string.

RETURN VALUE
	SUCCESS if the region is closed with no errors
	NOT_FOUND if no region with the given name is opened by the caller
