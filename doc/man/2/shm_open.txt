NAME
	shm_open

SYNOPSIS
	Status shm_open(const char *name, void **ptr)

DESCRIPTION
	Maps an existing shared memory region into the caller's address space and
	returns a pointer to the beginning of it. The region has the properties
	(i.e. flags) set by the call to shm_create that created the region. The
	call will fail if no region exists with the given name.

	shm_open is actually a wrapper around another function called
	real_shm_open, which performs the actual system call and adds an extra
	parameter, which is the length of the name string.

RETURN VALUE
	SUCCESS if the region is opened with no errors
	ALREADY_EXISTS if the region is already open in the caller
	NOT_FOUND if no region exists with the given name
	ALLOC_FAILED if there is no room in the caller's address space, or if
		an internal data structure allocation fails
