NAME
	s_fclose

SYNOPSIS
	Status fclose(int *fd);

DESCRIPTION
	Closes a file previously opened by fopen, flushing the contents.

RETURN VALUE
	SUCCESS if close and flush succeeds.
	FAILURE if file was not valid.

NOTES
	If fclose is called on CIO_FD or SIO_FD, instead of closing these
	files, their buffers are simply dropped, and they remain open for
	other programs.
