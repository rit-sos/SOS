NAME
	grow_heap

SYNOPSIS
	Status grow_heap(unsigned int *new_size)

DESCRIPTION
	Extends the heap of the calling process, if possible, and returns the new
	size of the process's heap.

	This function is intended to be called by the heap manager and should
	probably not be called by user program code directly. Calling this
	function without going through the heap manager will cause the heap
	manager to fall out of sync with the current size of the heap. This
	is not generally harmful, but not recommended.

RETURN VALUE
	SUCCESS if the heap was grown
	ALLOC_FAILED if they heap can't be grown any more, or if mapping
		otherwise failed.
