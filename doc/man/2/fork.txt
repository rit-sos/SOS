NAME
	fork

SYNOPSIS
	Status fork(int *pid)

DESCRIPTION
	Creates a new process at the point that fork is called by making a
	copy of the calling process. The new process gets a copy of the caller's
	memory at the time that fork was called, and continues execution from
	the same point.

RETURN VALUE
	SUCCESS if everything worked
	A variety of other status codes if it didn't

	On success, the parent gets back the pid of the child in the buffer
	pointed to by pid, and the child gets 0.
