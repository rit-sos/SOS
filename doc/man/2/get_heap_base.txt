NAME
	get_heap_base

SYNOPSIS
	Status get_heap_base(void **ptr)

DESCRIPTION
	Returns a pointer to the beginning of the heap. If this pointer is not
	used as the heap base then heap_grow will not work properly.

	This function is intended to be called by the heap manager and should
	probably not be called by user program code directly. There is no harm
	in doing so, however.

RETURN VALUE
	SUCCESS
