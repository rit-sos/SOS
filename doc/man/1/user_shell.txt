NAME
	user_shell

SYNOPSIS
	user_shell

DESCRIPTION
	A shell which allows for the launching of user programs. The shell reads
	from the CIO_FD to assemble a line. The line is then compared to the list of
	names of user programs, if there is a match then the program is launched.

	The shell also has built-in commands for doing the same things as
	shm_shell, but it uses SIO for input instead of CIO.

	The command "help" can be used to list all user programs executable by the
	shell.

PROMPTING
	The shell prompts for user input with "$: "

BUGS
	Its too small and too useless
