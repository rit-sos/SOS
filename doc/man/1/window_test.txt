SYNOPSIS
	window_test

DESCRIPTION
	This program exercises the user windowing library. It allocates a window and
	prints out some strings to test character output.
	
	It prints out a countdown using the relative cursor move to overwrite the
	numbers each time.

	Then it draws some lines across the screen to test the line drawing
	functionality.

	Finally it loops forever displaying a shifting color pattern on the window.
