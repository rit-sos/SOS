SOS Network Driver
Authors: Eamon Doran

[Purpose]
The network driver serves as communication mechanism
between multiple. Currently the implementation allows
for the End user to send PING messages and listen for 
PONG messages over layer2.

[Design]
Any single card in the e100 family is detected and the
Memory Mapped I/O Bar is gathered from the PCI bus
via ACM. The PCI location is printed to the screen
as well as the IRQ for the device. Memory Mapped I/O
and Bus Master is enabled for the PCI device. Then
the card is reset via a selective and then software reset.
A Command/Transmist block Ring and Receive Frame Area
(aka receive file descriptor). Then ISR is then
registered. The CU and are RU are then started.
The receive frame,  CNA transition, and Receive
Overrun interrupts are handled.

[Interface]

The kernel interface provides two functions
send and receive. Each takes a buffer and length of the
buffer.

The syscall interface is two commands
PING and PONG which both take a pointer
to a an array of Uint8 of length 6 which is the mac address
to listen or send to. If the broadcast mac is provided
it will send to all devices and receive from all devices.
